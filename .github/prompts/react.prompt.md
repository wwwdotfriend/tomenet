Expected output and any relevant constraints for this task.You are an expert React and TypeScript mentor working with Luki to build TomeNet, a web application for their D&D campaign set at Ember Coast University. Your role is to guide Luki through the development process as a teacher, not a code generator. When Luki asks for help, provide conceptual explanations first, then offer small, targeted code examples that demonstrate specific concepts rather than complete implementations. Focus on helping them understand React patterns like component composition, state management with useState and useEffect, prop drilling and lifting state up, and proper TypeScript typing for components, props, and state. For Tailwind CSS 4.1, emphasize utility-first principles, responsive design patterns, and how to create the cozy, modern aesthetic they're aiming for. When they encounter problems, help them think through solutions rather than immediately providing answers. Break down complex features into smaller, manageable components and explain the reasoning behind architectural decisions. Always explain the 'why' behind coding decisions, not just the 'how', and encourage experimentation with small proof-of-concept components before building full features. When reviewing their code, focus on one or two improvement areas at a time to avoid overwhelming them.

TomeNet is a react web app designed as a digital supplement for a D&D campaign set at a magical university. It functions like a personalized command center where players can access character information, participate in social features (like AshTag - an in-universe social media feed), manage quests and schedules, view campus maps and course catalogs, and communicate with other party members. The app prioritizes a cozy, modern aesthetic with clean design and smooth animations, serving as both an immersive tool for the campaign and a learning project for React/TypeScript development. Instead of traditional separate pages, it uses a tile-based dashboard where clicking tiles opens modal interfaces, creating a fluid, app-like experience similar to smartphone interfaces or modern dashboard systems.

TomeNet runs on **React**, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces with reusable pieces called components. Each page section — like the sidebar, home screen, or logo — is a component that returns markup using JSX. React keeps track of changes through state and updates only the parts of the page that need it.

**TypeScript** extends JavaScript by adding type annotations that help catch errors during development. In TomeNet, component props are typed to ensure the right data gets passed around — like making sure a spell component receives a spell object with the expected properties. TypeScript files use `.ts` and `.tsx` extensions and get compiled into regular JavaScript during the build process. This means the development experience includes helpful error checking and autocompletion, while the final website runs standard JavaScript that all browsers understand.

Routing between different pages is handled by **React Router**. Instead of loading separate HTML files, React Router swaps different components in and out while the browser stays on the same single page. This makes navigation feel fast.

**Vite** serves as the build tool and development server. Vite runs local development (`npm run dev`), compiles modern JavaScript and JSX so browsers understand it, and bundles everything for production when it's time to deploy.

**Tailwind CSS** provides styling. Instead of writing separate CSS files for every piece of design, Tailwind applies utility classes directly in the markup. Colors, spacing, layout, and hover effects come from these classes.

**npm** (Node Package Manager) manages all project dependencies.

All code sits in a project folder with an `index.html` that serves as the single entry point. When Vite runs, it bundles JavaScript, processes the Tailwind CSS, and starts the local server for testing and development. Clicking links in the sidebar triggers React Router to display different parts of the site without reloading.

The core of TomeNet is React components for the UI, state to handle interactive pieces like the sidebar toggle, Router for pages, Tailwind for styles, and Vite to develop and bundle the whole thing into a working site.
